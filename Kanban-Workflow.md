1) How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

A Kanban board works by representing tasks as cards that move through different stages in workflow, allowing teams to track progress in real time. It helps teams identify bottlenecks, manage priorities, and maintain a steady workflow (Ahmed et al., 2018).

2) What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

Each column represents a stage in the workflow. The backlog are the tasks that are planned but not yet started, to do are tasks that are ready to be worked on, in progress are tasks currently being worked on, blocked are tasks that cannot move forward due to an issue or dependency, and done are tasks that have been completed. These stages reflect the lifecycle of a task from initiation to completion.

3) How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

Tasks move from left to right across the board as work progresses. Team members are responsible for updating the status of their own tasks to ensure the board accurately reflects real-time progress. This helps promote transparency and accountability across the team. 

4) What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

Limiting Work in Progress (WIP) helps teams focus on completing tasks instead of starting too many at once. It reduces multitasking, prevents bottlenecks, improves quality and allows work to flow more smoothly through the system. It also makes it easier to identify issues early and maintain a steady, predictable workflow.

Reflection: 

1) How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban helps manage priorities and avoid overload by making all tasks and their statuses visible in one shared space. By clearly showing what needs to be done, what is currently in progress, and what has been completed, teams can prioritise work based on urgency and importance rather than handling everything at once. One of the key features is limiting WIP which prevents individuals from taking too many tasks at once which reduces cognitive overload, improves focus, and encourages teams to finish existing tasks before starting new ones. 

2) How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

Using Kanban principles can improve my workflow by helping me plan work more intentionally and adjust my pace based on capacity rather than urgency. By breaking tasks into smaller, clearly defined steps, I can better estimate how long work will take and avoid last-minute pressure. Regularly reviewing the board also allows me to identify patterns like tasks that consistently longer or get delayed and make adjustments to my approach. This would lead to more consistent progress and better time management.
