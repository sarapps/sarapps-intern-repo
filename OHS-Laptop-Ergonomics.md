1. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?

I don’t currently use much ergonomic equipment and I work directly on a laptop with no stand, external keyboard, or mouse. This often leads to severe back and neck pain because I end up crouching and looking down at my screen. To improve my workspace setup, the most helpful changes would be using a proper laptop stand to bring the screen to eye level and incorporating minor practical adjustments like placing pillows behind my lower back or pushing my chair forward so that my back stays flat against the chair (helping me minimise crouching over). Since I already have a fixed desk setup and keep my bed as a dedicated sleep space to remain productive, adding these tools would make my work area more comfortable and reduce the pain I currently experience.

2. What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?

I tend to round my shoulders, stare down at my screen, and slouch a lot which generally creates back and neck pain for me. This especially happens during exam periods where I am glued to the desk at home and in libraries for extensive periods of time. I try to prioritise movement in my day, but this often results in fitting it in at the start or end of the day rather than taking breaks during work sessions because I get very focused and forget to pause. To reduce strain and maximise my productivity, I want to work on sitting upright more consistently, doing simple back and neck stretches as well as adjusting my screen so that I’m constantly not looking down. I also want to remind myself to blink more to reduce eye strain. Building these small habits throughout the day will help me stay more comfortable without affecting my focus.

3. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?

I can use Focus Bear to schedule movement reminders, for example after completing four productive 30-minute focus sessions. Having those reminders built into my routine will make it easier to implement. I can also use simple visual cues like sticky notes on my desk or timed notifications reminding me not to crouch, to sit up straight, and blink. Seeing them as I work will act as a gentle nudge to correct myself throughout the day, thereby improving posture and reducing strain.

Tasks: 

1) I raised my laptop using a stand so the screen is closer to eye level and adjusted my chair positioning so my back stays fully supported. I also added a pillow behind my lower back to improve support and prevent strain  
2) A laptop stand would help me keep my neck upright and maintain eye level. While a chair with proper back support can make a difference in preventing future back pain  
3) Adding a movement break into my habits checklist on the Focus Bear app helps remind me of the importance of moving and taking breaks, making the rest of my day productive and reducing neck and shoulder strain  
4) I added sticky notes on my workspace as visual cues to remind myself to fix my posture, as well as taking movement breaks for breaks. This improved my productivity and reduced my level of neck, eye, and back strains
