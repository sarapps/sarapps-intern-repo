Reflections:

1. When should you use AI for assistance and when should you rely on your own skill?

I mainly use AI to make my writing sound clearer and more logical, and sometimes for brainstorming when I’m stuck. I still rely on my own ideas and creativity to help shape content and ensure it aligns with certain criteria (up to a good standard). I use AI as more of a tool to refine or organise what I already want to say

But for the more important parts like cross-checking facts, finding reliable sources, understanding real user needs, and making final judgement calls I should rely on myself. I also find it important that I keep my own voice and make sure the writing still sounds like me, even if AI helps with structure or clarity. 

2. How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

For me, over-reliance on AI would look like letting it write everything for me, using it without cross-checking reliable sources or depending on it instead of thinking through ideas myself first. To avoid that, I can start by brainstorming ideas on my own and doing a rough first draft before I bring AI into the process. That way, the ideas and direction still come directly from me. I can then use AI to refine the vocabulary, improve the flow of it, or check the clarity of what I've already written. This helps me get the benefits from AI without replacing my own thinking and losing my personal voice

3. What steps will you ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

When using AI tools, I will make sure I never enter any sensitive or confidential information like names, emails, account details, or anything that would relate to users. If I need help with wording or structure, I’ll either summarise the situation in a general way or replace the real details or replace real details with anonymity. I will also avoid copying and pasting full documents or messages into AI tools and instead only share parts that are necessary.

Tasks:

1) One task I improved with an AI tool was rewriting my messy paragraph from my notes to make it clearer and easier to read. I fed this rough draft into AI and asked it to improve the language while maintaining my tone.   
2) The AI-generated output met my standards and it completed what I wanted it to do. However, it still needed some adjustments like particularly formal words and some minor tweaks to tone match how I normally write. Since the paragraph was about my own experience, there wasn't much to fact-check.   
3) One best practice I will follow is never inputting any sensitive or confidential information by keeping the prompts generalised and anonymised. Also I will always edit the AI output so it stays in my voice
