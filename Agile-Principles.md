Research and Learn:

* Agile: A way of working where teams deliver work in small pieces, get feedback early, and improve continuously. Instead of planning everything upfront, teams learn as they go and adapt to change. Agile has no long plan upfront, work happens in small cycles, feedback is fast, change is unexpected, and teams learn from users and adjusts. In comparison to traditional project management which plans everything at the start, strict deadlines, and work happens in big phases (e.g., design to build to test to launch).   
* The core values from the agile manifesto:  
  * 1\. Valuing people and collaboration over rigid processes \+ tools \- talking and working together matters more  
  * 2\. A working feature is more important than long reports  
  * 3\. Customer feedback is seen as more significant than contract negotiation \- listen to real users instead of just sticking to a plan  
  * 4\. Responding to a change over following a rigid plan \- adjusting the plan according to changes that come up and not ignoring it  
* Principles from the agile manifesto focus on delivering small pieces frequently, welcoming changing requirements, working together everyday, building around motivated teams, reflecting and improving regularly, keep work simple, measure progress through real outcomes, talk face-to-face when possible, focus on user value and experience  
* Scrum \= work in sprints, fixed goals each sprint, roles are clearly defined  
* Kanban \= continuous flow (no sprints), team works on their own schedule, focus on the principle of work in progress (WIP)  
* Focus Bear tends to lean towards Kanban rather than Scrum because it focuses on creating continuous improvements as it is a new app, adjusting based on feedback from users and teammates. Scrum would be too rigid, and Kanban can help Focus Bear adjust to feedback and make small improvements.

Reflection: 

1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

For me, the biggest benefits of Agile are more collaboration and faster learning. Because the team communicates often, everyone stays aligned and goals are more likely to be met. It also helps me learn from other marketing roles and understand the bigger picture, instead of working alone.

A challenge for me is the constant change based on user needs. The ADHD community has shifting priorities, so my content might not resonate later if things move quickly. Another challenge is that everyone works on their own schedule, which means motivation and timing are individual, and small tasks can pile up. Sometimes priorities feel unclear because the process is informal and flexible, not rigid like a traditional plan.

2. How can Agile principles help improve my role and responsibilities?

Agile principles can help my role by encouraging early feedback and collaboration. Instead of writing a full article alone, I can share outlines and ideas early so the team can give some form of feedback on whether or not this would resonate with the target audience. Working in small pieces makes it easier for my content to match the campaign direction and user needs. I can also respond to change by adjusting topics or tone if the ADHD community is talking about something new. This makes my writing more useful and relevant.

Task:

1) Summarise the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in my own words: Scrum has fixed sprints with clear goals and ceremonies like sprint planning and retrospectives. The team plans what they will do at the start of each sprint and follows that plan for a fixed time period. This contrasts with Kanban which is more continuous and adaptable, where work occurs according to the team’s pace. It adjusts constantly based on priorities.  
2) Identify one Agile principle that will be most useful in my work: The Agile principle that will be most useful for me is responding to change over following a plan. The neurodivergent audience is always changing, and new social trends can appear suddenly. If I follow a fixed plan, my content might not match what the community actually needs or cares about. By responding to change, I can tweak my writing, shift topics, or even create a new blog article that aligns with current priorities. This helps the content reach more people and supports the goal of building awareness for the app.
