1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?

I hope to learn how to apply my marketing skills in a real-world context while contributing to something that feels personally meaningful to me. I joined Focus Bear because productivity, routines, and tools like to-do lists have always been a big part of my life. I believe in working with quality rather than just quantity, and having a good routine is what makes me feel the most productive. I’ve spent years trying to build better discipline and structure, so learning how Focus Bear designs habits, routines, and behavioural tools is something I really want to understand.

This internship is also meaningful to me on a personal level. I’ve grown up with family members and friends that have ADHD (from classical to inattentive to overfocused) and I’ve witnessed firsthand how they struggle with distractions, routines, and focus. Being part of something that could help my brother and my friends feels like I’m contributing to something bigger than just myself.

On a personal growth level, I hope to build a more consistent routine, build more discipline, and improve my work-life balance. Even though I try hard to manage my digital distractions it still affects me so I want to learn strategies that would help me navigate this better. I also want to adapt what I learn here to support those around me who face similar challenges.

2. What skills are you most excited to develop?

I’m most excited to develop practical marketing and content skills in a real-life context. I’ve done many assignments throughout my degrees at University of Melbourne, but this is the first time I get to essentially apply everything I’ve learnt in a way that impacts a real product and real readers. That’s something that I’ve always wanted, to see my work used outside of the university.

There are a lot of areas I’ve touched on in theory but haven’t had proper hands-on experience with like writing articles for online audiences, using SEO basics, and working with content management tools. I’m excited to build confidence in research, writing, editing, and optimising content.

Another thing I’m looking forward to is understanding how different teams in a startup work together. I’m interested to learn more about team coordination, cross-functional workflows, and how ideas move from brainstorming to execution. I’ve always been curious about how marketing, content, and product decisions happen behind the scenes.

3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?

I think I can contribute a mix of clear writing, strong organisation, and a sharp attention to detail. I’ve always been someone who tries to understand people and how they think, which helps me communicate in a genuine way (being a communication of both reliability and thoughtfulness). I think this will reflect well in my writing, especially when creating content for different types of readers.

From my studies, I can contribute skills in research, marketing strategy, and understanding audiences. I’m excited to apply these in a real-life context rather than just assignments. I can also draw on the experiences of the people around me who have ADHD and cross-check whether ideas or content resonate with them. Having a younger brother with inattentive ADHD and friends that have various types of ADHD has given me a deeper understanding of their challenges. It has made me more empathetic and aware of how focus, routines, and productivity are not the same for everyone

My own ups and downs with having a solid routine and procrastination also help me relate to the people we’re writing for. I understand what it feels like to want structure but struggle with consistency, so I bring both empathy and personal insight to the content.

In terms of work style, I’m someone who is always trying to improve myself and who genuinely wants to contribute to something meaningful. I would call myself a quick learner, open to feedback, and motivated by helping others. I think these qualities would help me work with the team effectively.

4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

One area I feel less confident in is writing for real audiences. I’ve done a lot of written tasks at university but it was not really targeted towards people who would genuinely read and use the content. The same goes for SEO as I’ve learnt the theory but never applied it in the workplace. I’m also a little nervous about writing directly for neurodivergent audiences because I want the content to feel authentic and genuinely helpful, worrying that the content might not “land” or speak to their personal experiences and challenges. Therefore, improving these skills would help me become a more practical and adaptable writer which is useful and important for my future career.

5. What does success in the internship look like?

I see success in this internship in terms of being able to improve my writing, building genuine confidence, and being able to publish real content that actually helps neurodivergent users. I want to reach a point where I feel comfortable writing for real audiences, especially for people that think, learn, and focus differently. I’d also want to become good at SEO and learn how to publish blogs online in a way that feels professional and impactful. I mainly define success through professional growth (developing practical skills that can be applied to future roles) but because Focus Bear is centered on supporting people, I also see it as creating meaningful content that ‘lands’ and helps someone become more productive. Publishing something with my name on it would be surreal and exciting, and it would mean a lot to me personally because I love helping others. Knowing that something I wrote could be read, shared, and genuinely useful would feel like an accomplishment.
