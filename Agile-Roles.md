 Reflection:

1. What is my role, and how does it contribute to the Agile Process?

My role at Focus Bear is a content writer intern. I will be writing long-form blog articles that help neurodivergent audiences, especially people with ADHD, learn to implement more practical strategies. My articles focus on topics such as ADHD productivity, executive function, study habits, the experiences of neurodivergent audiences, and routines that actually work. The goal of my work is to reach more users, grow awareness of the app, and support the community with useful content.

In my articles, I plan to connect real problems with Focus Bear features. For example, when talking about time blindness, I can show how the strict focus timer and blocking mode supports people who get distracted. When writing about routines, I can link to the to-do list, adjustable focus sessions, and other features. This makes the content helpful in context, not just promotion.

I join stand-ups with my supervisor and sprint planning with the full marketing team. It helps me understand where I fit in the bigger picture and how different marketing roles work together. Being involved in these ceremonies helps me stay aligned with priorities and learn how my writing should support the overall strategy.

2. How do my responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

I expect to collaborate most with the social media intern, the marketing strategy intern, and the marketing team lead. Even though my focus is long-form articles, much of my work connects to their work. For example, my short-form captions need to be posted by the social media intern, and scheduling needs to align with the overall campaign plan.

To write content that supports the team, I will need campaign goals, timing for posts, tone of voice guidelines, and insights about the audience and what problem we are focusing on this month. My writing needs to land well with the other roles so the message is consistent across articles and social content.

Tasks:

1) Write a short description of how my role fits into the agile team: I am responsible for creating long-form articles and short social content that supports Focus Bear’s marketing goals. My writing focuses on practical strategies for neurodivergent audiences and connects these strategies to features in the app. I collaborate with the rest of the marketing team to align timing, tone, and campaign direction. My work supports Agile by contributing content that can be reviewed early, iterated on, and used in ongoing marketing campaigns.  
2) Identify one other role i can frequently collaborate with and describe how I can improve teamwork with them: I expect to collaborate most with the social media intern and the marketing strategy intern, because my content needs to match the timing of campaigns and be posted to the right platforms. A challenge I might face is feeling nervous that my writing does not match the campaign message or that I did not fully understand the strategy. To improve teamwork, I want to share early outlines and ask for feedback during sprint planning. This helps me learn faster, stay aligned with the rest of the team, and make sure the content fits the campaign before I spend too much time writing.
