1. What makes Focus Bear Different from these apps (Freedom, Cold Turkey, Tiimo, Routinery)

Comparison of Freedom \+ Focus Bear: Freedom mainly helps with distraction control because it can sync blocks across all devices at the same time, making it almost impossible to escape into procrastination elsewhere. Focus Bear doesn’t have this level of rigid, simultaneous cross-device blocking and focuses more on syncing habits and data across platforms. Freedom’s interface is also very list-heavy and quite plain, which can be seen as less motivating or overwhelming especially for users that have inattentive ADHD. It doesn’t really acknowledge habits, routines, or the emotional side of productivity like Focus Bear does take into account. Both habits offer similar pricing structures where a free version includes a limited version, but then Freedom offers a paid yearly plan ($40 per year) while Focus Bear does monthly plans ($2.99 per month) \- with Focus Bear being slightly cheaper overall.

Comparison of Cold Turkey \+ Focus Bear: Cold Turkey is labelled as the ‘toughest website blocker on the internet’ whereby once the user locks a block, it's almost impossible to override. It can block websites, apps, or even the entire internet and uses a strict, no-exceptions approach. Focus Bear has a strict mode, but it still allows unblocking and is designed around encouragement rather than punishment. Cold Turkey focuses purely on blocking and getting as many hours of work done as possible, but it does not consider whether the work is meaningful or if the user might be procrastinating on a different device. It also doesn't support habits, routines, or gentle motivation which Focus Bear includes to help with long-term productivity, not just a means of forced focus.

Comparison of Tiimo \+ Focus Bear:  Tiimo is an AI powered productivity app specifically designed for people with ADHD, autism, and executive functioning challenges. It creates simple, visual schedules, turns tasks into realistic plans, and allows a lot of customisation, including widgets that make the day easy to see at a glance. It also syncs across devices and offers a free plan with a short trial for the pro version. However, Tiimo doesn’t focus on distraction blocking at all, which means users might still struggle with performing the tasks they plan. It’s good for lists and visual organisation, but without blocking support, some users may not follow through. Focus Bear fills that gap by including blocking alongside habit-building.

Comparison of Routinery \+ Focus Bear: Routinery is built around creating strong routines using timers and to-do lists to help align intention with action. It’s useful for structure and habit formation, similar to parts of Focus Bear, but it doesn’t have website or app blocking features. This means that even with a strong routine, users can still get easily distracted and not actually complete what they set out to do. Focus Bear includes blocking to prevent this issue, combining habits, timers, and distraction control all in one. Routinery also offers flexible pricing options (weekly, monthly, six-month, yearly, and lifetime plans) giving users more budget freedom compared to the more standard subscription model of other apps.

2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

If I were a full-time user of apps, some reasons why I would choose Focus Bear over other apps is because it has a gentle, human tone that really tries to understand the consumer. It doesn’t feel robotic or harsh. Apps like Cold Turkey force you to focus but some days forced focus isn’t enough as the user would need encouragement, emotional support, or simply just having someone to acknowledge the hardships of starting. Focus Bear also celebrates small wins, which is especially motivating for people who just need a tiny push to get out of a rut. It also feels easy to use and beginner friendly (with over 2 weeks of personal usage), making it a great starting point for anyone trying to get back on track to accomplish their personal and academic/work goals.

I’d also pick Focus Bear because it aligns intention with action by combining the best features of other apps in one place: the distraction blocking of Freedom and Cold Turkey, the neurodivergent-friendly design of Tiimo, and the routine-building of Routinery. Instead of switching between three different tools, Focus Bear becomes an all-in-one option which supports people with executive functioning challenges. And unlike apps that focus purely on long hours of deep work, Focus Bear emphasises the quality of work rather than the quantity.

3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

One feature that other apps have which Focus Bear doesn’t is cross-device blocking. Apps like Freedom and Cold Turkey make it hard to switch devices during a focus session, and this can be especially helpful for people with inattentive or classic ADHD that look for loopholes the minute their attention shifts. The key difference is that I don’t mean a harsh or punishing ‘forced focus’ mode like Cold Turkey but a more supportive option for users that know they need stronger mechanisms to maintain focus and stay on track. Having a multi-device block removes the impulsive jump to other devices without making the user feel trapped or pressured. This keeps the experience encouraging and neuro-divergent friendly while still giving them structure to rely on. 

4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear should make?

Based on my research, one improvement I think Focus Bear should make is introducing an optional cross-device blocking feature. This would help maintain focus by removing the loophole of switching between devices when their attention drifts. But I think this only works well if it’s paired with more human, encouraging messages that congratulate users on what they’ve already done and gently nudge them forward, rather than pressuring them. With this combination users are less likely to feel overwhelmed and more likely to take action that actually aligns with their intentions. Since the hardest part for many neurodivergent users is starting, giving them both practical support and the emotional reassurance could make a meaningful difference in maximising their overall productivity.
