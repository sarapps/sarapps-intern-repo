1. What security measures do you currently follow and where can you improve?

The current security measures I follow include avoiding suspicious links from unknown numbers or emails, using strong passwords, having a password manager, locking my laptop and devices when I’m not using them, and already having two-factor authentication enabled on Google and YouTube accounts. However, I can still improve by enabling 2FA on more platforms and being more careful with WiFi security as I connect to public networks often.

2. How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

I can make secure behaviour a habit by building it into my routine like enabling device auto-lock and backing up data and files regularly. Treating security as a small daily habit rather than something I only think about when something goes wrong will make it more automatic. 

3. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

I will enable 2FA on all important accounts, avoid reusing passwords, and regularly review my security settings such as checking which devices are logged in, removing old devices that I no longer use, and making sure my recovery details are up to date. These will help me protect my personal information, ensuring they are secure.

4. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

If I suspected a security breach, I would immediately change my password which would lead to being automatically logged out of all devices and any unauthorized sessions. I would also enable or update 2FA (if not already done) to add an extra layer of protection. After that I would notify the Focus Bear Team so that everyone is aware that the activity wasn’t coming from me and can take necessary steps on their side. Acting quickly would help contain the issue and minimise any potential damage from occurring.

With the tasks:

1) I already use strong passwords \+ password manager \+ have now enabled 2FA wherever possible  
2) I already use a password manager which help me continue to store my passwords securely in there  
3) My devices already lock with a timer of 1-2 minutes so no one can access sensitive information when I step away. I tend to lock it myself as well for extra precaution  
4) My new security habit will be avoiding public WiFi when working for Focus Bear and only connecting to secure networks. As this internship entails remote work and handling company-related information, I want to make sure I’m protecting their data. If I ever need to use the internet outside of home, I will use my mobile hotspot instead of public Wifi. This habit is something I will actively follow throughout the internship to keep my work environment secure.
