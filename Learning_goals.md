1. Why Do You Think Focus Bear Was Created?

Focus Bear was founded from the CEO’s personal experience of struggling to stay focused due to his ADHD and Autism. It was a tool built to  help people with neurodivergence in building healthy habits, reduce distraction, and provide structure in their day-to-day activities. The app particularly works as it makes the process easier and tasks feel simpler.

2. What Problem is Focus Bear Solving?

Focus Bear solves the issue of inconsistent routines, distractions from other phone apps, and procrastination. Many people want to be productive but don’t know where to start, have a hard time staying focused, or remaining consistent with their daily healthy habits. Therefore, the app addresses these problems that occur in work and study environments by providing a clear structure, providing accountability, and through reminders.

3. Why do you think this mission is important?

The mission is important as it tackles many pain points that people struggle with everyday in terms of focus, mental health, and remaining consistent with habits. Focus Bear serves as a solution to support a more healthy and productive lifestyle where users are able to balance focus with rest, routine and wellbeing. This is especially meaningful for people that are constantly stuck in poorly structured routines, as well as people that get overwhelmed and stressed easily.

4. How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

Focus Bear aligns with me because I really value having a balanced and consistent routine. I’ve spent years trying to build discipline and structure in my life, but I’ve always found it hard. I tend to have days where I’m extremely productive while other days where I can’t focus and do anything at all. I have an idea in my head of what a ‘successful day’ entails and when I don’t meet that standard I am extremely critical and disappointed in myself.

I’ve always wanted a daily routine where I sleep early, wake up early, and spend less time scrolling or procrastinating. I also struggle with insomnia, so getting better sleep has always been a goal of mine. I feel my best when I can tick off tasks on a to-do list, especially when I get my biggest tasks done first. I like organisation tools, but I mostly use simple ones like the Notes app to write up these to-do-lists, Pomodoro timers when I’m studying, and my basic laptop calendar to highlight any important dates I will forget.

Because of this, Focus Bear’s approach to giving a structure, routine, and healthier productivity aligns with the lifestyle I want to build. It fits with the things I value like balance, routine, mental clarity, and most importantly reducing stress.

5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I relate to many of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve. I struggle a lot with getting distracted by my phone. Once I finally put it down, I’m usually fine but starting tasks is usually the most difficult point. I also find it difficult in maintaining consistency. This is seen when I bulk study a week before exams or before assignments are due which leaves me feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and burnt out. I tend to perform well under pressure, but only because I’m forced to start when everything piles up at once. 

I feel like my whole day depends on how I start it. If I start the morning well, the rest of the day usually follows. Whereas if I start badly, my mind convinces me that the entire day is ruined, even if I still get work done. Stress definitely affects me as I get brain fog, overthink, shut down, or push myself to overwork by studying 8+ hours a day to feel like I’ve “caught up.”

I also personally connect to Focus Bear because I’ve grown up around people with ADHD which has shaped how I understand productivity. My younger brother has inattentive ADHD, and my parents didn’t understand him, they often called him unmotivated and lazy before he was diagnosed. He struggled throughout high school: missing homework, being late, zoning out, and finding it hard to focus. On the other hand, my current roommate has overfocused ADHD where she can stay locked into tasks for hours and finish everything in one sitting.  Because of these different experiences, it made me realise that people function in very different ways and what feels important to me might not be important to someone else. Focus Bear’s tools could actually support both of them like helping my brother with routines and reducing distractions and helping my roommate with balancing her hyperfocus and healthier habits beyond work and academics.

This makes the challenges Focus Bear aims to solve feel more meaningful to me as it connects with me personally and socially through people around me.
