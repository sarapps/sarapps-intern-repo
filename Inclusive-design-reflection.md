Reflection:

1. How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

To adjust my communication style to be more inclusive to other neurodivergent users and teammates, I think my biggest step is to be more patient. I normally am quite short-tempered but as I’ve gotten older I’ve realised how crucial this is for people with ADHD. I also try to break things down into smaller, more manageable tasks so the person doesn’t feel overwhelmed, especially for those with inattentive or classic ADHD who can shut down when faced with too much information at once.

I make an effort to keep my tone gentle and understanding, because I know from watching friends and family struggle that their difficulties aren’t their fault. In terms of communication, I try to use simple language, short sentences, and avoid long explanations. This is because staying concise helps them actually absorb and comprehend what I’m trying to say. If I were the one struggling with executive functioning, I’d want understanding and no extra pressure, so I try to offer the same to others by validating their feelings and giving some form of suggestions. Sometimes that means helping them prioritise what’s important (a form of ranking system on a to-do–list) or encouraging them to “just start for five to ten minutes” to make the task feel less overwhelming instead of looking at the list of tasks to complete (which often cause them to feel like its ‘impossible’). These small adjustments make communication much more accessible and respectful.

2. What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

Some common UX pitfalls which could make Focus Bear less accessible include cluttered interfaces with too much text, too many colours, or confusing navigation. This can overwhelm users, making them exit the app. Long paragraphs instead of short simple words could also make it harder for users with ADHD to stay engaged. Notification overload is another issue where too many reminders can feel like they are bombarded with information which thereby would reduce motivation instead of increasing it.

On the communication side, vague instructions, harsh tone of voice, or giving too many steps at once can make users shut down or feel discouraged. Guilt-based messages like “you should have done this by now” also tend to backfire, especially for people who already struggle with executive functioning. Other pitfalls include pressure-based messaging, unrealistic expectations, and a lack of empathy for what the user is actually dealing with neurologically. I’ve seen this firsthand with friends and family when they’re presented with too many tasks at once, they get frustrated and feel like the whole thing is impossible (which often results in them giving up for the rest of the day). And if someone reacts with annoyance or impatience, it only makes them feel more defeated. Being aware of these patterns is important so the app remains supportive to neurodivergent audiences rather than overwhelming.

3. What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

One practical change I can make is testing my content with real neurodivergent people instead of relying solely on my own judgement. Even if I feel positively towards my writing that it is deemed ‘effective,’ that doesn’t automatically mean it actually works for the audience which Focus Bear is designed for. Getting quick feedback from people with ADHD or Autism including my friends or family helps me see whether the content truly holds their attention or if their focus drifts. This ensures that non-voluntary attention is created which consistently holds engagement rather than emotional shut down.

Tasks:

1) Summary of First-Person Account ([https://lindiebotes.com/2024/10/07/my-top-productivity-tools-for-adhd-%F0%9F%A7%A0/](https://lindiebotes.com/2024/10/07/my-top-productivity-tools-for-adhd-%F0%9F%A7%A0/)): The blog is written by someone who is diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, they share the tools and techniques which help them manage and improve motivation and productivity. It also discusses how traditional productivity methods don’t always work because they can be too rigid, overwhelming, or guilt-driven. Apps that provide customisation tools, focus on aesthetics, ability to integrate with other apps, and simple interfaces help them the most. They also mention that ADHD brains can be inconsistent, so tools need to be flexible rather than strict. What stood out is how much they value tools that *reduce cognitive load*, use clean design, and avoid long blocks of text. Thus, anything overly cluttered or demanding tends to make them shut down.  
2) Identify a design/communication improvement based on the blog: One improvement I’d make is adjusting how the app responds when users pause the screen-blocking feature. Right now the delayed timer gets longer each time you pause, and messages like “You already paused once today” or “Do you really want to pause?” can feel a bit guilt-based, especially if I’ve already completed a lot of focus sessions (something they don’t take into account, not celebrating users' small wins which can create a sense of defeat). Instead of assuming the pause means I’m avoiding work, the app could consider how much focus time I’ve already done that day. For example, if I’ve already completed a few deep-work sessions, the reminder could be more understanding or neutral. This would keep the experience supportive rather than making users feel guilty for taking a break, which is important for people with ADHD who already struggle with shame and motivation. This would help the app feel more balanced and aligned with its message of healthy work–life habits.  
3) Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning: 

Executive functioning struggles can be really frustrating and it's completely okay to feel stuck sometimes. Just a reminder that you’re not behind, you’re not doing anything wrong, and you’re not alone \- this happens way more  than you think\!

Let me try to make this feel a little bit easier to you… Instead of trying to finish everything at once, just start with one tiny step. Aim for two minutes. Even something like opening the file or writing a title may get you one step closer to your goal. After that, you can decide if you want to keep going. 

Whether or not you continue, you’re already 1% better than before\! You’re doing better than you think, and you’re not expected to be perfect.
