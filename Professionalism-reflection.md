1. Have you experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

An example of teamwork and professionalism I’ve experienced was during a university group project where we were asked to complete a full rebranding report. Our group agreed on Red Bull very quickly, which helped us start with a clear direction. We divided roles early, and everyone made sure their sections met a strong standard by doing proper research and following the criteria closely. We also worked on a week by week basis instead of leaving things to the last minute, therefore keeping the workload manageable and ensuring everyone stayed up to speed. Communication was consistent through social media, and whenever someone feel confused or struggled with something, they brought it up openly and it was addressed right away. Feedback was always handled kindly rather than defensively, which made the experience feel supportive and ultimately successful.

2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

To make sure my communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive I follow some simple steps. First, I use straightforward language and include small examples when needed so that my ideas are easy for everyone to understand. I also ask the group if anything is unclear and encourage people to raise questions in the chat so no one feels confused or out of the loop. 

To stay respectful, I’m careful with my tone and say please and thank you. I also try to avoid interrupting as I am genuinely interested in what others have to say. For inclusiveness. I make sure everyone has space to share their viewpoint and I never dismiss ideas, because even small suggestions can contribute to the final outcome. When delegating tasks or deadlines, I keep messages short and direct. But when I’m brainstorming I use longer, more thoughtful messages so we can successfully build on each other’s ideas

3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

To help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment, I try to be friendly and approachable so people feel comfortable around me. I like bringing a sense of realness into my personality, which usually breaks any tension and helps build a genuine connection within the group. Being a little humourous and bringing good energy also keeps things light, especially during stressful moments.

At the same time, I maintain professionalism by  setting and meeting deadlines, creating small check-in points for team members to raise concerns and stay aligned with tasks, and make sure my work meets a high quality. I also try to stay organised with consistent week-to-week communication and be someone others can rely on. 

4. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

To prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues, I make sure to outline the main points I want to cover so I can update everyone on my progress without leaving anything out. I review my notes beforehand and write down any questions that I need answered, especially if they relate to deadlines, expectations or further steps I need to take. During the meeting, I tend to take notes of important details like dates and timings so I don’t forget anything later and to avoid re-asking the same question (actively listening). 

5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

Being proactive during my internship would be taking initiative rather than being told what to do and staying ahead of my workload. For example, I was given 34 issues for onboarding on GitHub to be completed within 3-6 weeks with around 15 hours of work required each week. To stay on track, I plan to break this down into manageable steps like completing around 3 tasks a day and aiming for roughly two hours of focused work per day. This helps me to maintain momentum and prevents everything from piling up over time. It's the end of Wednesday the 26th (3 days into the internship) and I’ve completed my 10th task showing that I’m a few steps ahead. Additionally, it means asking questions early on when something is unclear. This is seen with me joining the discord server and directly messaging Jeremy when I was unclear about work days.

6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don’t get a response and when would you escalate?

To follow up with colleagues or supervisors when I need information or action from them, I would first message them directly so they don’t feel like I’m calling them out or embarrassing them.. If they don’t respond, I would then send another message in the team chat (waiting around 24 hours to three day) so it doesn’t feel like I’m pestering them

If I still don’t get a response, then I would consider escalating it, especially if a deadline is coming up and their part is important (affecting my progress and affecting the rest of the team). For example, mentioning their name in the next weekly team meeting or letting my supervisor (Beverly) know privately so they are aware of the circumstances. I might also personally check in with other team members to see if anyone else has heard from them to identify if there is anything personal going on. This way I am balancing being respectful and understanding with making sure the work is completed at a good quality.

7. What are some things you won’t do?

One thing I definitely won’t do is ghost teammates or ignore messages no matter how busy I am. I’ll always communicate where I’m at regardless of my progress because I know firsthand how frustrating it is when people disappear and only reply right before a deadline (where I experienced this firsthand with my group assignments and projects at university). I also avoid using any kind of passive aggressive, rude, or dismissive language as I feel this does not improve progress rather it creates tension with other teammates. Additionally, I won’t ignore feedback or react defensively because I genuinely believe that everyone’s voice adds something valuable to the final outcome, no matter if it is a small or big idea. Lastly, I won’t misrepresent my progress or capabilities as I feel like this only makes things harder later, and I’d rather be upfront and ask for help instead of silently struggling so I can perform my best.
