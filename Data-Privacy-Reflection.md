1. What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

I already take many steps to keep my data secure in my daily tasks like using strong passwords, enabling 2FA across my Google accounts, and storing all credentials in a password manager. However, there are still some areas that can be improved like making sure my devices are regularly updated since software updates often include important security patches. Additionally, backing up my work to ensure I don’t lose important information in case something goes wrong. My goal is to rely more on my personal hotspot especially when I’m dealing with sensitive information so I’m consistently working on secure networks while handling any company or user data.

2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

The ideal way to handle sensitive information is to keep everything stored in secure platforms rather than on personal devices. When sharing documents, the best practice is to use restricted Google Drive links with the right permissions instead of sending files as email attachments. This makes sure that only the people that are meant to see it can access it.

For disposal, sensitive files should be permanently deleted (not just removed from the trash). This means emptying the recycle bin, removing old versions, and making sure that there are no backups that remain. Ideally confidential data should not be downloaded to personal devices to prevent any risks of data leaks. 

3. What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues and how can they be avoided?

Common data privacy issues can arise from small mistakes like clicking on suspicious links, reusing the same passwords across different platforms, or sending files through personal apps where they can be shared and accessed by people who shouldn't see them. Connecting to public WiFi is another risk, because it makes it easier for others on the network to access files. These mistakes could be avoided through doubling checking certain links before clicking it, checking file permissions before sharing documents, using strong unique passwords, as well as sticking to secure networks rather than public ones. 

Tasks: 

1) One habit I want to adopt is properly disposing files instead of just moving them to the trash. This can be done through permanently deleting the documents like emptying the recycle bins, as well as cross checking that there are no duplicates or backups that I still own. This will help prevent old files from being accessed accidentally or having the wrong people access them.  
2) A key learning for me is realising how important it is to actually check sharing permissions before sending any file. It's such a small step but it prevents documents and information being leaked to the wrong people. I’m going to make this more of a habit so everything I share stays controlled and secure
