User Manual for Sar

My Role:

* I am working on completing my onboarding tasks on GitHub and preparing to move into my main projects as a Content Strategy Intern. Over the next 6–8 weeks, I’ll be developing 10–15 long-form articles, creating content audits with recommendations and citations, and producing short-form social copies.  
* The days and times I work are: mostly Monday and Friday (around 5 hours each), with additional flexible hours spread between Tuesday–Thursday so that I reach 15 hours per week overall.

How I Work Best: 

* I do my best work when it’s late morning to afternoon,  that’s when my focus feels strongest. I like having clear steps or guidance so I know exactly what criteria I need to meet. I work really well independently, but I also enjoy light check-ins or some form of collaboration to keep me on track. Deadlines help me structure my week and create a sense of purpose. My ideal environment is a café or a busy, “everyone’s working” space, usually with my AirPods in so I can completely zone into my tasks.  
* I struggle when instructions are vague, communication is inconsistent, or I have to chase supervisors for clarity with no response. Not knowing what’s expected of me makes me overwhelmed and sometimes causes me to shut down. I also find starting tasks difficult (though using focus apps has helped me improve with short, high-quality bursts of work). I also get stressed when I’m being micromanaged. I feel like having space to complete tasks at my own pace before the deadline makes me much more effective.

Communication Style:

* I prefer messages to be short and direct when I’m asking a specific question, but more detailed when someone is explaining a task so I know exactly what needs to be done. I like clear steps and when people get to the point quickly. I still appreciate a bit of friendliness in messages, but I also like straightforward, honest feedback, whatever gets the job done and helps me improve. I generally reply fast, but I also understand everyone has different schedules.  
* The best way to reach me is through Discord or email, since I check both constantly on my phone and laptop. I’m comfortable with any format (casual or formal messages, voice notes, typed instructions) as long as communication is clear. For more complex conversations or idea discussions, I find calls much more efficient than long email threads, since they help clear up questions instantly.  
* If you need something urgent, the fastest way is to privately message me on Discord or send an email labelled as urgent. I’m usually quick to respond, and I’ll happily jump on a short call if immediate clarification or action is needed.

Collaboration & Teamwork:

* I work best in a team when everyone has clear roles and goals to complete individually, and when we can openly discuss ideas or any challenges that come up. I like being able to bounce off other people’s thoughts and build solutions together. A communicative and responsive team helps me stay motivated, especially when everyone takes responsibility for their part because each contribution affects the others. I also like having weekly check-ins to update progress, ask questions, and make sure everyone is aligned.  
* My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is ghosting (disappearing for days with no replies) especially close to deadlines. I get frustrated when people avoid ownership and give excuses at the last minute, or only try to contribute right before submission. I value accountability and real effort over perfection.  
* If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I’m focused on listening, noting down any important details, and making sure I understand everything clearly. Most of the time, the situation that occurs is that others have already raised the point or question I wanted to make, so I don’t repeat what has already been said. Once I have something to contribute, I’ll jump in.

Focus & Productivity:

* I stay focused when I’m working in an environment that feels good to be in. I usually start my day at my home desk in the morning, and if my attention drops I switch to a place where other people are working, like a café or library as seeing others work helps me do the same. I almost always have music on because it helps me tune out everything else. I plan my work in blocks (2 hours morning, 2 afternoon, 2 evening if needed) and take breaks when a task is finished instead of forcing a timer. Accountability helps a lot as if I know someone will check in, I push myself more.  
* Things that distract me include my phone and social media. Unclear instructions also make me overthink and slow down because I’m worried I’ll get something wrong. If someone talks to me or calls while I’m really locked in, it completely breaks my focus.  
* The best way to support my productivity is through clear goals and deadlines that help me plan my time properly (if I know the end point, I can break the work up and stay on track). A weekly check-in call is ideal so I can ask questions, reflect on progress, and make sure I’m aligned (instead of a long email chain). If something isn’t fully clear, examples really help me understand what “good” looks like. Regular feedback is also important to me. I want to know what I’m doing well and what I need to improve so I can grow faster.

Feedback & Growth:

* I like feedback to be direct, clear, and honest, but with a slight level of softness. I like knowing what I did well so I can repeat it, and what didn’t work so I can fix it. Examples really help me especially when something needs big improvement because I learn fastest when I can see what “good” looks like. I’m happy to receive feedback either mid-process (like through rough draft check-ins) or at the end of the work. The format doesn’t matter (Discord, email, or a short call) as long as it’s straightforward and easy to understand.  
* When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is tell me straight away with a private message. Be honest about what’s wrong and give some guidance on how to fix it or approach it differently next time. A mix of directness and encouragement works best as I don’t take feedback personally, I use it to improve.  
* I appreciate it when teammates communicate proactively and don’t leave others stuck alone. Quick replies, honest updates (even if progress is slow), sharing examples, and helping each other when someone is struggling all make collaboration feel meaningful to me. I like weekly group check-ins and occasional private messages to stay aligned.

Fun Facts and Quirks:

* One thing people often misunderstand about me is that people often see me as intimidating and standoffish at first, but I’m actually quite talkative, sarcastic, and love making friends. I warm up fast once I feel comfortable  
* A fun fact about me is I’m half Thai and lived in Thailand for 20 years, but I can barely eat spicy food and I’ve never tried durian.  
* My work superpower is taking an idea and making it better. I constantly spot improvements, new angles, and 100 different ways to refine a piece of work. Nothing is ever ‘finished’ in my head.
